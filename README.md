# Timed-Quiz-with-Highscores

## Project Description

This project was built for the University of Toronto School of Continuing Education Coding Bootcamp.This application is a quiz about basic development questions. 
There is a timer of 60 seconds, which is used to calculate the final score of the user based on their ability to answer the questions correctly and within the 
time limit. The score is then recorded in local storage to create a leaderboard based on the scores of different quiz takers.

This application was built with:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript

At this moment in time, there are still major issues with the application. 
  1. The questions do not load on the application. The answers load correctly, but the question remains undefined. 
  2. The application does not recognize answers that are correct. It considers all answers to to be incorrect.

## How to run
1. Clone repository
2. Open files using editor (I personally recommend Visual Studio Code)
