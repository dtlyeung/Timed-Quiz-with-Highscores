# Timed-Quiz-with-Highscores

## Project Description

This application is a quiz about basic development questions. There is a timer of 60 seconds, which is used to calculate the final score of the user based
on their ability to answer the questions correctly and within the time limit. The score is then recorded in local storage to create a leaderboard of users.

This application was built with:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript

At this moment in time, there is still a major issue with the application. 
  1. The questions do not load on the application. The answers load correctly, but the question remains undefined. 

## How to run
1. Clone repository
2. Open files using editor (I personally recommend Visual Studio Code)
